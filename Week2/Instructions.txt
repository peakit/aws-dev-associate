Task:

What’s given

A personal AWS account was created, and billing alerts were set up.
What to do

Sub-task 1 – Create 3 User Groups

Let’s imagine that we have created an AWS Account that will use all members of our AWS program(Coordinator, Mentees, Mentors(Experts)). For all these users it will be better to create different groups with different permissions because for example Coordinator has more permissions than Mentee. Please create 3 user groups:

CoordinatorsGroup
MentorsGroup
MenteesGroup
Sub-task 2 – Create policies and roles

Create a policy named FullAccessPolicyEC2.
Configure the FullAccessPolicyEC2 to allow any actions on the EC2 resources.
Similarly, create policies for S3:
FullAccessPolicyS3 – everything’s allowed.
ReadAccessPolicyS3 – only get and list actions.
Create one role of EC2 Type (Trusted Entity) per each policy configured so far (note – these roles won’t be used right now, but might be reused in the upcoming EC2 module):
FullAccessRoleEC2
FullAccessRoleS3
ReadAccessRoleS3
Create one group per each policy configured so far:
FullAccessGroupEC2
FullAccessGroupS3
ReadAccessGroupS3
Create 1 user from the 1st group, 1 user from the 2nd group, and 1 user from the 3rd group.
Add inline policy for user1 for write access to S3. The inline policy is a policy created for a single IAM identity (a user, group, or role). Inline policies maintain a strict one-to-one relationship between a policy and an identity. For more information please see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html
Install the latest version of the AWS CLI. Please follow this guide https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html.
Configure named profiles for each user from the step #6 to be used with AWS CLI in the subsequent modules. For more info please see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html
